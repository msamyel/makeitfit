# Make It Fit!

This is a project which I created out of necessity in the
time during which I managed multiple social media accounts.

Each social media platform a different number of characters
which it allows in a single post. Each platform also has
different rules for counting the number of characters in a hypertext link,
or non-English characters such as kanji symbols or emoji.

Some examples of these differences are illuminated in the `tests/CharacterCounters.test.ts` file.

## Online version

The contents of `dist/` folder are publicly available
on the tool's website [make-it-fit.online](https://make-it-fit.online/).

## Running locally

To run the tool on you machine, execute the following two commands:

```

```
